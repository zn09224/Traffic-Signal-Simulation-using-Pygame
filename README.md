# Traffic-Signal-Simulation-using-Pygame
This repository contains the code for my final project in the CS101 course at my university. The project is a 4-way traffic signals simulation created using Pygame.

## Features

- **Pygame Implementation**: The simulation is built using Pygame, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.
  
- **Traffic Management**: Explore the code to see how the simulation handles traffic flow, including vehicles moving in different directions, obeying traffic signals, and managing intersections.
  
- **Signal Logic**: Delve into the logic behind the traffic signal system, covering timing for signal changes, coordination between different intersections, and handling various traffic scenarios.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. Then, simply execute the main script `traffic_simulation.py` to start the simulation.

```bash
python traffic_simulation.py
